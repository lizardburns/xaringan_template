# Intro

- `{xaringan}` uses [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com/) to create nice html presentations
- Write presentations in R markdown and quickly turn your doc into a slick slide-deck

---

# Slides

- break up your markdown into slides with **3** dashes (hyphens) `---` on their own line

--

- incrementally display slide content with two dashes `--` on their own line

---

# Images

Insert images using the usual markdown syntax:

`![some text](path_to_file.png)`

![logo](logo.png)

---

# Sidebars

- use `.left-column[blah blah]` & `.right-column[blah blah]` to create a sidebar layout

---

# Sidebars

.left-column[
  ## What is it?
]
.right-column[
  .red[*]A simple, in-browser, Markdown-driven slideshow tool targeted at people who know their way around HTML and CSS, featuring:

- .red[Markdown formatting], with smart extensions

- .red[Presenter mode], with cloned slideshow view

- .red[Syntax highlighting], supporting a range of languages

- .red[Slide scaling], thus similar appearance on all devices / resolutions 

- .red[Touch support for smart phones and pads], i.e. swipe to navigate slides

# Sidebars

.left-column[
  ## What is it?
  ## Why use it?
]
.right-column[
.red[*]If your ideal slideshow creation workflow contains any of the following steps:

- Just write what's on your mind

- Do some basic styling

- Easily collaborate with others

- Share with and show to everyone

Then remark might be perfect for your next slideshow!

# Columns

- wrap content in `.pull-left[blah blah]` and `.pull-right[blah blah]` to create equal columns

.pull-left[
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
mtcars %>% 
  head()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
iris %>% 
  head()
```
]

---

# Extra CSS

- you can add any additional styling you want
- write your own CSS to define classes

--

For example:
- Add red text by defining it in extra.css: `.red { color: red; }`
- then wrap .red[any text you want to be red] in `.red[]`

---

# Presenter notes

- just use 3 question marks `???` on their own line and then add whatever you need below
- then use the keyboard shortcut `p` to view slides in presenter mode
- see more in [R markdown: The definitive guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan-format.html#xaringan-notes)

???

Simple as! Include images if you like and use *any* other standard markdown features
